## Overview 
Reinforcement Learning is the _computational_ approach to learning from interaction (Sutton & Barto). Autonomous agents performing goal-oriented learning based on experience represents the holy-grail of AI. Recent successes of Reinforcement Learning algorithms include [human-level performance on many Atari games](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf), [beating world's best Go player](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero), and robots learning [dexterity](https://blog.openai.com/learning-dexterity/) and [grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10293).
